            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </article>
        <p> My name is Thuy. I was born and grew up in <strong>Viet Nam</strong> which is a small country in <em>South-East Asia</em>.
            I moved to <strong>Canada</strong> in November 28 <sup>th</sup> ,2018 as a student.
    This is my first year in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> IDM </abbr>, so I find it very excited to discover new things. I haven't had any skills about web code.
    I will try my best for it and hope you give me help to be better.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite hobby is cooking. My grandmother taught me how to cook my first dish when I was 8. My family enjoyed it so much so that is when I started this hobby. 
   Sometimes, I love playing video game and watching movies when I’m free. I also want to improve my English and I’m glad to be here.
   <em>This is one of the motivation quotes that I like most</em>:
   <q>The difference between who you are and who you want to be, is what you do</q> - <em>Bill Philips</em>. 
   <strong>The more you try. the better you get</strong></p>
